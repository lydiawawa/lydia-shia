Final Project for Dats 6202

#### Abstract
It is undoubtedly to the most that domestic animals are comfort to the souls. According to a research observed in the duration of nearly 25 years that living with pets provides certain health benefits. Pets help lower blood pressure and lessen anxiety. They boost our immunity. They can even in fact help you get dates. 

Even with the benefits that a pets can bring, not all pets are been appreciated by the society. There are approximately 2.7 million healthy or treatable pets out there who still need to find a home each year. Many action has been taken to reduce the number of astrayed pets, such as adoptions by shelter and charity organizations that provide low cost vet services. The rate of euthanasia has been reduced tremendous because of these joint efforts, yet we still have work to do. Currently, just 29 percent of dogs and 33 percent of cats in American homes were adopted from shelters or rescue groups. (Source: Huffington Post) 

The project aims to examine the life expectancy of a Austin shelter animals by using data collected in 2016 as evidence to investigate the cause of unwantedness in animal shelter,  thereby to increase the awareness of inhumane treatment to shelter/abandoned animals by promoting protection to those animals.

#### Introduction
“I’m Max and I’m the luckiest dog in New York, because of her.”  This quote appears in the start and the end of the Movie.

The Secret Life of Pets was released in 2016 with an aim to increase the awareness of involuntary treatments for shelter animals. As the movie portrays how the fear of the animals towards animal control center, the terrors expressed by those pets led the audience further ponder on the source of such fear. Around the same year, an animal shelter in Austin, released its data of its sheltered animals’ life expectancy in Kaggle community, hoping to gain awareness of shelter animal treatments and allowing the public to be aware of traits that contribute to negative outcome such as death or eunicidation.

Referring back to the movie, the main character Max was once a shelter animal, his life was forever changed after adoption, but the same case may not apply to every abandoned animals.
